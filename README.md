# PDC-Project

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms, that are:

- Random Forest

- XGBoost

- Adaboost

The project is part of a Parallel and Distributed Computing course, with the objective of optimizing the computational efficiency of these algorithms using parallel and distributed approaches.

## Project Goals

- Implement fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch.

- Analyze the computational efficiency of each algorithm.

- Optimize the code by leveraging parallel computing techniques such as multi-threading and multi-processing.


## Implementation

Following the pseudocode present in the base papers, we implemented it in Python hoping to see the results reflected. We have referenced the papers in the report for this project. The methodology is elaborately explained along with the results we achieved after experimenting on different datasets ourselves.
